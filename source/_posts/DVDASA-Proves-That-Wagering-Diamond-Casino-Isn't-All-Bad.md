For years, there has been speculation that graffiti artist David Choe may have had an undisclosed relationship with the Diamond Casino. This week, in a candid interview with podcast host Joe Rogan, Choe finally came clean about the relationship.

"It's no secret that I've had a thing for the Diamond Casino for a while now," said Choe. "I mean, who hasn't? But what people don't know is that I actually had a relationship with the casino. It was all very secretive and clandestine, but we were in love."

When asked how the relationship started, Choe recounted a chance meeting at an art show. "I was hanging out with some friends at this art show and I saw her across the room," said Choe. "She was so beautiful and exotic looking. We locked eyes and it was love at first sight."

Choe went on to describe his initial interactions with the casino as being "tinged with excitement and danger". However, over time he grew to love her for her flaws. "She wasn't perfect, but that's what made her special," said Choe. "She could be irrational and unpredictable at times, but that's just who she was."

Although their relationship ultimately ended in heartbreak, Choe still looks back on those times fondly. "Even though it didn't work out between us, I'm grateful for what we had," said Choe. "She taught me a lot about myself and I'll never forget her."
