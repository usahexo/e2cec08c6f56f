#  Legal Sports Betting Up In Smoke In Montana

The Montana Supreme Court this week struck down a state law that made it illegal to bet on sports. The unanimous decision overturned a more than 70-year-old ban on the practice.

Justice James Shea, writing for the high court, said the law violated the right to free speech. "Sports betting isspeech," Shea wrote.

The decision means Montanans can now legally bet on sports through online offshore operators and at tribal casinos. It's not clear yet how much interest there is in sports betting in the state, but Shea said it's likely there will be a rush by people to take advantage of the change in the law.

"It is likely that many Montanans who have been illegally betting on sports for years will now feel empowered to seek out authorized sportsbooks," Shea wrote.

Shea was joined in his opinion by Justices Patricia Cotter, Beth Baker, Dirk Sandefur and Mike Wheat.

The state attorney general's office had argued that the ban was needed to protect the public from gambling addiction and other social evils. But the high court said there was no evidence that Montana residents were betting illegally because there was no legal way to do so.

"The State has failed to show that prohibition of speech is necessary to avoid these harms," Shea wrote.

#  Nevada Leads The Way With Legal Sports Betting

Nevada has been at the forefront of gambling and casino development since the early days of the industry in the United States. So it should come as no surprise that they would also be one of the first states to legalize sports betting.

On Tuesday, May 14th, Governor Brian Sandoval signed a bill into law that allows sports betting in Nevada casinos. The bill had passed through both the state Assembly and Senate with relative ease, showing just how popular this form of gambling is.

Sports betting is not a new phenomenon; it has been around in one form or another for centuries. However, the way it is handled and regulated has changed dramatically over the years. In some instances it has been legalized and taxed, while in others it has remained illegal but nevertheless thrived underground.

Now that Nevada has legal sports betting, other states are likely to follow suit. This is especially likely given that the Supreme Court overturned a federal law last month that prohibited such betting outside of Nevada. This decision could have major implications for the gambling industry as a whole.

Some people are concerned that legalizing sports betting will lead to more people becoming addicted to gambling. However, there is evidence that suggests otherwise. In fact, a study by Oxford University found that legalizing sports betting does not lead to an increase in problem gambling rates.

So why is legalizing sports betting such a big deal? There are several reasons:

1) It will generate much-needed revenue for states and municipalities.

2) It will create jobs in the casino industry.

3) It will give people another form of entertainment to enjoy.

4) It will be good for the economy overall.

#  New Jersey Continues To Champion Legal Sports Betting

When the Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of the federal ban on sports betting (the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, or PASPA) came through in May of this year, it widely expected that many states would jump at the opportunity to join New Jersey in offering legal sports betting.

Now, six months later, it’s clear that New Jersey is one of the few states that is actually moving ahead with plans to offer legal sports betting. In fact, as of November 2018, there are only seven states with active legislation to legalize sports betting.

Why is New Jersey so far ahead of the curve when it comes to legalizing sports betting?

There are a few factors at play here. For one, New Jersey has been championing legalized sports betting for years – ever since voters rejected a 2014 referendum to allow sports betting in the state. So when the Supreme Court ruling finally came down, state officials were already primed and ready to move ahead with implementation.

Additionally, New Jersey has been able to capitalize on its existing gambling infrastructure. Atlantic City is home to several casinos, which can be easily transformed into sportsbooks. In other states that may not have a preexisting gambling infrastructure, implementing legal sports betting may be more difficult.

Finally, New Jersey has been very aggressive in marketing its new sports betting product. The state has created a dedicated website (njplaysports.com) and launched a multi-million-dollar advertising campaign aimed at attracting bettors from all over the country.

Other states looking to legalize sports betting would do well to take note of New Jersey’s success so far – it’s clear that there’s a lot to be gained by being one of the early adopters in this space.

#  Pennsylvania Opens UpSports Betting five. Rhode Island Follows Suit legalizing Athletics Wagering

Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have both opened up sports betting, following the footsteps of New Jersey. This new development is sure to cause some excitement – and anxiety – among fans.

Pennsylvania’s new sports betting law allows for online and in-person betting. The first bets were placed at the state’s 12 casinos on September 21. The law permits single-game wagers on professional and college sports, including basketball, football, baseball, and hockey.

Rhode Island’s new law is similar to Pennsylvania’s. In Rhode Island, fans can place bets at two tribal casinos: Twin River Casino in Lincoln and Tiverton Casino Hotel in Tiverton. Like Pennsylvania,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) Rhode Island allows for online and in-person betting on all major professional and college sports.

So far, both states are seeing a positive response from bettors. At the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh, $1 million was wagered in the first two days after the launch of sports betting. Joe Massaro, senior vice president of marketing at Rivers Casino, said that the casino is seeing “high demand” for its new sportsbook.

Not everyone is happy about the advent of legal sports betting, however. Sportscasters like Joe Buck have spoken out against it, saying that it will ruin the integrity of America’s favorite pastime. Others worry that gambling addiction will lead to financial ruin for many people.

Despite such concerns, the trend toward legalization of sports betting shows no sign of abating. In addition to Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, five other states have recently passed laws legalizing sports betting: Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Connecticut. And more states are likely to follow suit in the coming months and years.
