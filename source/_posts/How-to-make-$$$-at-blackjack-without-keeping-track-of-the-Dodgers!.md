#  How to make $$$ at blackjack without keeping track of the Dodgers!

First of all, let me dispel a myth. A lot of people think you need to keep track of the cards to win at blackjack. This is simply not the case! 

In this article, I'm going to teach you some simple techniques that you can use to increase your odds and make some money at the casino!

So, without further ado, let's jump in:

# 1. Choose your game wisely
The first step is to choose a game that suits your level of expertise. If you're just starting out, I would recommend playing a lower stakes game until you get the hang of things.

Higher stakes games can be more challenging, but they also offer higher payouts if you win. So it's ultimately up to you how much risk you want to take.

# 2. Stay disciplined and bet within your means
This is probably the most important blackjack tip of all: always stay disciplined and only bet what you can afford to lose. 

This will help prevent you from making costly mistakes and losing too much money in one sitting. Remember, gambling should be fun, not a means to make money!

# 3. Avoid betting on ties
One thing you want to avoid when playing blackjack is betting on ties. This is because the odds of winning are quite low (around 8%). 
</p> <p>Instead, focus on betting on the individual cards. This will give you a better chance of winning and increase your chances of walking away with some profits.</p> <p># 4. Use basic strategy charts as a guide</p> <p>There are lots of different strategies that can be used when playing blackjack, but beginners should start off by using basic strategy charts as a guide.</p> <p><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Blackjack" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's an example</a> of a basic strategy chart for blackjack.</p> <blockquote class="wiki-content-pullquote">"Never split pairs of 10s or 5s – sometimes splitting other pairs is a good idea"</blockquote> 

Now that we've covered the basics, let's move on to some more advanced tips:

 # 5. Count cards if you want to increase your chances of winning Even though you don't need to track cards in order to win at blackjack, knowing what cards have been played can give you an advantage over the house edge.</p> 

There are various methods for counting cards which I won't go into detail here, but if you're interested in learning more I suggest checking out this article: <a href="https://www.gamblingwithanedge.com/card-counting/" rel="noopener noreferrer">How To Count Cards In Blackjack</a>. 

# 6. Double down on 11 If the dealer shows a card that's equal or lower than 6 (eights through ace), then it's generally a good idea to double down on 11.</p> <blockquote class="wiki-content-pullquote">"Doubling down gives you the opportunity to win two hands for the price of one."</blockquote> 

# 7. Use basic strategy when splitting pairs When splitting pairs, always use basic strategy charts as a guide in order to maximize your chances of winning.</p> 

For example, never split pairs of 10s or 5s – sometimes splitting other pairs is a good idea.</p> # 8. Take insurance when the dealer has an Ace up If the dealer has an Ace up (which means they could have a Blackjack), then take insurance if offered.</p > <blockquote class="wiki-content-pullquote">"Insurance pays off 2:1 if the dealer has Blackjack."</blockquote>>

#  How to win big in blackjack - without following the Dodgers!

Most casino-goers believe that in order to make money playing blackjack, they must follow certain rules and tips religiously. This couldn't be further from the truth! In fact, there are a few easy ways to ensure you come out ahead when playing this popular card game – without even having to break the bank.

One simple way to increase your chances of winning when playing blackjack is to always split Aces and 8s. If you have two Aces, for example, then you should always split them up into two separate hands. This increases your chances of drawing a ten (which would give you a blackjack) and improves your overall odds of winning.

Another easy way to give yourself an edge when playing blackjack is to avoid doubling down on 11. This can be a risky move, as it can lead to you losing more money if the next card dealt is a ten or face card (giving the dealer 21). Instead, try doubling down on hands totaling 9, 10 or 11 – as these are more likely to result in a winning hand.

Lastly, remember that it's important to set limits on how much money you're willing to lose while playing blackjack. This will help you stay in control while gambling and prevent you from spending too much money in one sitting. By following these simple tips, you'll be well on your way to enjoying some successful blackjack sessions – without even needing to follow the Dodgers!

#  How to make money while playing blackjack - Dodgers be damned!

It’s baseball season, and while that means the Dodgers are in our heads (and hearts), it also means there’s money to be made at the blackjack tables.

Here’s the strategy: find a casino that offers blackjack with a 6:5 payout for naturals instead of the traditional 3:2. With this higher payout, you can put the house edge in your favor by playing only hands that have a chance of winning.

For example, if the dealer is showing a 5, don’t bet on a hand like 18 because the dealer has an advantage. However, if you have a hand like Ace-6, then you should definitely bet because there’s only one card left that can give the dealer 21 and beat your hand.

In general, when you have three or more cards totaling 11 or less, you should hit (take another card). With two cards totaling 10 or 11, you should stand pat (keep your cards). And with 12 through 16, you should double down (mutual) if you think you can get another card without going bust.

The reason to stick to these basic blackjack strategies is because they lower the house edge from around 0.5% to just 0.1%. That may not seem like much, but over time it can make a big difference in your bottom line.

So get out there and enjoy some America’s favorite pastime…while making some money in the process!

#  Money-making tips for blackjack players - ignore the Dodgers if you want to win!

Whether you’re a professional blackjack player or just starting out, there are a few tips that everyone can benefit from to make more money while playing. First, always remember the basic rules of blackjack: the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, and beating the dealer’s hand in the process.

Another key rule to remember is that blackjack pays out 3:2 odds, so if you bet $10 and win, you’ll walk away with $15. That said, here are a few more money-making tips:

* When deciding how much to bet, always remember that you want to make as much money as possible while still being able to walk away from the table with your chips intact. A good rule of thumb is to gamble no more than 1-5% of your bankroll on any given hand.

* If you’re not sure what move to make, it’s often best to just stick with your original bet rather than doubling down or splitting pairs. This will at least ensure that you don’t lose any money if things don’t go your way.

* Another thing to keep in mind is that different games offer different odds; for example, blackjack offered at many Las Vegas casinos pays out 6:5 instead of 3:2. So if you have the opportunity to play at a game like this, be sure to take advantage!

* Finally, one of the most important tips for winning at blackjack is simply to know when to quit. If you’ve had a fortunate streak and are up a lot of money, it might be wise to take your profits and walk away – there’s no sense in risking it all by continuing to play. Conversely, if you start losing money then it might be time to abandon ship and try again another day.
