#  How did w88,California,The Soccer World Cups come about?

The Soccer World Cups began with a group of men getting together to play a game of soccer in the lawn of a priest’s house in 1884. The game was such a success that they decided to do it again the following year, and then the year after that. In 1894, they played in the first international soccer match, between England and Scotland.

The popularity of soccer kept growing, and in 1904, FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association) was founded. The first official Soccer World Cup was held in Uruguay in 1930. Since then, the cup has been held every four years, with only a few exceptions due to World War II.

The United States has hosted the World Cup twice- once in 1994, and again in 2026. The 2026 tournament will be the first time that three countries (the U.S., Mexico, and Canada) have jointly hosted the Cup. Each country will host different parts of the tournament. The games will be played in 10 stadiums across 3 countries, with 60 games being played in total.
