#  Odds now favor Browns to win Super Bowl in 2020

The Browns have had a turbulent few years, but that could all be changing in 2020.

According to the latest odds from BetOnline, the Browns are now favored to win Super Bowl LIV. The team sits at +1200, just ahead of the Chiefs (+1400) and Patriots (+1600).

It’s worth noting that these are only odds and don’t necessarily mean anything, but it signals that the Browns are seen as a serious contender heading into next season.

The Browns went 7-8-1 in 2018, which was a major improvement from the 0-16 season they had in 2017. They’ve got a lot of young talent on their roster, including quarterback Baker Mayfield and wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., so there’s no reason why they can’t make another run at the playoffs in 2020.

In fact, many experts are already predicting that the Browns will win the AFC North next season.

“I would not be surprised at all if the Cleveland Browns won the AFC North in 2020, especially if they bring back (head coach) Freddie Kitchens, who did a great job with Baker Mayfield last year,” said ESPN analyst Dan Graziano.

So far, things are looking good for the Browns. They should be one of the most exciting teams to watch in 2020 and they definitely have what it takes to win Super Bowl LIV.

#  Cleveland Browns are the new favorite in the AFC North

The Cleveland Browns have been the favorite in the AFC North since the start of the offseason. The Browns made some big moves in free agency, signing superstar wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. They also signed defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson and quarterback Tyrod Taylor.

The Pittsburgh Steelers have lost key players in Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell. The Baltimore Ravens have lost linebacker C.J. Mosley and safety Eric Weddle. The Cincinnati Bengals have lost quarterback Andy Dalton and wide receiver A.J. Green.

The Browns are looking to make a run to the Super Bowl this season. With Beckham Jr., Richardson, Taylor, and a talented young roster, they have the talent to do just that.

#  Betting sites now include the Browns in Super Bowl odds

The Cleveland Browns have been on the rise in recent years and this is reflected in the latest betting odds for the Super Bowl. Although they are not considered one of the favorites, many online sportsbooks now include them in their list of potential contenders.

This is a significant shift from just a few years ago, when the Browns were seen as one of the worst teams in the NFL. They have made several big moves in the past few drafts, including selecting quarterback Baker Mayfield with the first overall pick.

Mayfield has already shown some impressive skills and there is optimism that he can lead the Browns to some playoff appearances in the coming years. The team also has other talented players, such as wide receiver Jarvis Landry and defensive end Myles Garrett.

There is no doubt that Cleveland still has some work to do before they can be considered true contenders for the Super Bowl. However, their improvement over the past few years has been noticeable and it will be interesting to see how they fare in future seasons.

#  Las Vegas says the Browns will be a contender this season

The city of Las Vegas has spoken and they are confident that the Cleveland Browns will be a contender for the Super Bowl this season.

“There’s no doubt in our minds that the Browns are going to go all the way this year,” said Jay Kornegay, vice president of race and sports operations at the Westgate Las Vegas Superbook.

The Browns haven’t been to the playoffs since 2002 and they haven’t won a playoff game since 1994. But Las Vegas is confident that this is going to be their year.

“We’ve seen all the offseason moves that they’ve made and we think they’re going to be a force to be reckoned with this season,” said Kornegay. “I know it might sound crazy, but we really think they have a chance to win it all this year.”

The Browns open the season against the Pittsburgh Steelers on September 9.

#  Could legalized sports betting help the Browns finally win a championship?

After years of being the laughing stock of the NFL, could legalized sports betting finally help the Cleveland Browns win a championship?

There’s no question that the Browns have had a hard time winning games in recent years. In fact, they haven’t had a winning season since 2007. And with just one playoff appearance in that time, it’s fair to say that Cleveland fans are desperate for a championship.

Could legalized sports betting be the answer?

On the surface, it certainly looks like it could be. After all, if people are betting on games, that means they have a vested interest in seeing their team win. And that could lead to more wins for teams like the Browns.

But there’s also no question that legalized sports betting would bring with it some major risks. For one thing, it could lead to rampant game-fixing and corruption. And it could also lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates.

So is legalized sports betting worth the risks? That’s something that each individual fan will have to answer for themselves. But there’s no doubt that it could provide some much-needed excitement for Browns fans in particular.
