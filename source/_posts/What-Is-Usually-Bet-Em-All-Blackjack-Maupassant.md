#  How To Play What Is Usually Bet Em All Blackjack Maupassant 

In a game of blackjack, the players are each dealt two cards. The object of the game is to draw cards until you have 21 or come as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The player whose hand has the highest value wins the game.

The Ace can be counted as either 1 or 11, depending on what makes sense for the hand. Cards 2-10 are worth their face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points.

If you have an Ace and a 2-9 card, you can either take another card (hit) or stop at 18 (stand). If your second card is an Ace, 10 or any other face card, then you must hit unless you already have 21 in which case you stand no matter what the total value of your cards is.

In some casinos, the dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17. In other casinos dealers must hit on all counts except 17 where they must stand.
