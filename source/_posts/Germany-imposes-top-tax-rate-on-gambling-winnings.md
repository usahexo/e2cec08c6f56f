#  Germany imposes top tax rate on gambling winnings

Germany has decided to impose a top tax rate on gambling winnings, in a bid to prevent high-earners from dodging taxes. The new rule, which came into effect at the start of the year, means that anyone who wins more than €2,000 from gambling will have to pay tax at a rate of 45 percent.

This is significantly higher than the top tax rate for income and capital gains, which stands at 42 percent. It is also higher than the 35 percent rate applied to winnings from lotteries and betting.

The move is part of a broader effort by the German government to clamp down on tax avoidance. In November last year, it announced plans to introduce a “supertax” of 25 percent on income above €250,000. This would be in addition to the existing top tax rate of 42 percent.

The government also plans to introduce a “speculation tax” on financial transactions. This would be levied at a rate of 0.1 percent on purchases and sales of stocks, bonds and other securities.

The new measures are expected to raise an additional €4 billion per year in revenue.

#  Germany charges top tax rate on gambling winnings

The top tax rate in Germany is applied to gambling winnings. Gambling profits are considered income and are subject to income tax. In addition, a “sportwettenabgabe” (gambling tax) is imposed on gross gambling receipts. The tax rates vary depending on the type of gambling activity. Gambling operators must pay a 19% tax on gross gaming revenue while players must pay a 5% tax on net gambling profits.

In 2017, the German government collected €651 million in taxes from gambling activities. This was an increase of 5% from the previous year. The majority of the revenue came from sports betting, followed by casino games and poker.

The German government has been increasing its efforts to combat illegal gambling in recent years. In 2018, it closed down more than 1,000 unlicensed online casinos. In addition, a new law came into effect which requires online platforms to obtain a license from the state in order to offer their services to German citizens.

#  Germany sets top tax rate on gambling winnings

The German government has set a top tax rate of 25 percent on gambling winnings, the Finance Ministry said on Wednesday. 

The new tax rate, which applies from January 1, 2019, replaces the current flat-rate tax of 19 percent. The ministry said the higher rate would only apply to individuals with taxable annual income from gambling winnings of more than €500,000 ($572,000).

The move is part of a package of planned tax hikes that also includes an increase in the top rate of income tax to 45 percent from 42 percent.

Some Labour politicians have criticised the proposed increases, saying they disproportionately benefit high earners.

#  Germany announces top tax rate on gambling winnings

On November 5, the German government announced a top tax rate of 45% on gambling winnings. The new rule will take effect on January 1, 2020.

Under the current rules, gambling winnings are subject to a progressive tax rate that ranges from 25% to 42%. The new top tax rate will apply to all gambling winnings above €500,000.

The government said the move is needed to ensure "fair taxation" of gambling profits. It added that the higher tax rate will also help to curb illegal gambling activities.

Reaction to the news was mixed. Some people argued that the higher tax rate will discourage people from gambling and could lead to a decline in tax revenue from the gambling industry. Others welcomed the move, saying it will help to protect vulnerable people from getting into financial trouble.

#  Germany levies top tax rate on gambling winnings

The German government has announced that it will be levying a top tax rate of 45% on gambling winnings. This is in addition to the standard income tax rate of up to 43%.

The new tax rate will apply to all forms of gambling, including casino games, sports betting, and lotteries. It will come into effect on January 1st, 2019.

Gambling is a major industry in Germany, with over €17 billion in gross gambling revenue generated each year. The government is hoping that the new tax will bring in an additional €780 million in revenue annually.

The move has been met with mixed reactions from the gambling community. While some operators are supportive of the measure, others feel that it will damage the industry and lead to job losses.

Critics argue that the high tax rate will deter people from gambling, leading to a decline in revenue. They also say that it will push players towards illegal and unregulated forms of gambling.

Supporters of the measure argue that it is necessary to ensure that the gambling industry pays its fair share of taxes. They also point out that other European countries have similar tax rates in place.
