#  Casino says don't worry about gambling losses on Baccarat

Gambling losses on Baccarat can be deducted from your taxable income, the Casino said in a statement.

“Baccarat is one of the most popular casino games and we want to remind our players that they can deduct their gambling losses on this game just like any other casino game,” said the Casino spokesperson.

Players are allowed to deduct their losses up to the amount of their winnings. So, if you have a net loss (losses exceed winnings) for the year, you can deduct that amount on your tax return. But if you have a net win (winnings exceed losses), you can’t deduct your losses.

The IRS considers Baccarat to be a game of chance, so gambling losses are deductible. Other games of chance such as slots, roulette and blackjack are also considered allowable deductions. However, there are some restrictions: You can only deduct your losses if you itemize your deductions; and you can only deduct gambling losses up to the amount of your winnings for the year.

Gambling is considered a “bad bet” by the IRS, so it allows taxpayers to write off their gambling losses as a miscellaneous deduction. This deduction is subject to two limitations: It can only be claimed if you itemize your deductions; and it can only be deducted up to the amount of your winnings for the year.

If you have more than one type of Miscellaneous deduction, you may want to consider grouping them together on Schedule A (Form 1040) to maximize their impact. This will allow you to claim more of your allowable deductions and reduce your taxable income. You should speak with an accountant or tax specialist if you have questions about whether or not you should itemize your deductions – or if gambling losses are worth grouping with other Miscellaneous deductions.

#  Pennsylvania man wins nearly $9000 playing Baccarat

A man from Pennsylvania has hit the jackpot while playing Baccarat at a casino in Atlantic City, winning nearly $9000.

The man, who has not been identified, was playing at the Borgata casino when he placed a $100 bet on the banker's hand and won. In doing so, he walked away with a payout of $8917.

Atlantic City casinos are currently undergoing a renaissance, thanks to efforts by Governor Chris Christie to revitalize the area. The Borgata is one of the most successful casinos in the city, and it seems that players are just as keen to win big here as they are in other gambling destinations like Las Vegas.

Baccarat is a simple game to play and has become increasingly popular in recent years. The aim of the game is to bet on which of two hands - the player's or the banker's - will be closest to 9. Players can also bet on a tie being drawn.

There are three possible outcomes in Baccarat - a win for the player, a win for the banker or a tie. The payout for each outcome varies depending on how much you wager, but as this Pennsylvania man proves, there is potential for some serious wins.
