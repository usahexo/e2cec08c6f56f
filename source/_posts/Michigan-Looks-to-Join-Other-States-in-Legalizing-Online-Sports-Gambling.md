#  Michigan Looks to Join Other States in Legalizing Online Sports Gambling

Michigan state legislators are in the early stages of drafting a bill that would legalize sports gambling within the state. This would make Michigan the fourth state in the nation to legalize some form of online sports gambling, joining Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Mississippi.

Some supporters of the bill argue that legalizing online sports gambling would bring in much-needed revenue to the state. They say that it would be a boon to businesses and create jobs in the gaming and tourism industries.

Others argue that legalizing sports gambling could lead to increased rates of problem gambling, and could pose a risk to the integrity of sporting events.

What is clear is that there is growing momentum nationwide for legalizing some form of online sports gambling. It will be interesting to see how this plays out in Michigan – and across the country – in the years ahead.

#  Proposal Would Allow Online Gambling in Michigan

A proposal that would legalize gambling on the internet in Michigan is moving forward in the legislature.

The proposal, which was introduced by state Representative Brandt Iden in February, would allow people over the age of 21 to gamble on the internet. The bill has been referred to the House Regulatory Reform Committee for further review.

Under the proposed bill, Michigan residents could gamble on websites that are licensed and regulated by the state. The bill would also create a new Gaming Control Board to regulate online gambling in Michigan.

Iden said that he introduced the bill because he wants Michigan to be “at the forefront of this industry.” He added that legalizing online gambling would bring new jobs and revenue to the state.

Critics of the bill argue that it could lead to addiction and other problems. But Iden said that he is confident that regulating online gambling will help protect consumers.

If approved, Michigan would join a growing number of states that have legalized online gambling. Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware all allow online gambling, and several other states are considering similar proposals.

#  Bill Introduced to Legalize Online Sports Betting in Michigan

On Wednesday, November 14, Michigan state representative Jim Tedder introduced a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state.

Under the proposed law, Michigan residents would be able to place bets on professional and collegiate sports through licensed online and offline gambling operators. The bill would also allow bettors to place wagers on fantasy sports contests.

“It is time for Michigan to get in on the multi-billion dollar global sports betting market,” said Tedder in a statement. “This legislation will provide much-needed revenue for our schools and communities while protecting consumers and keeping our state’s gaming laws up to date.”

Michigan is one of several states that are considering legalizing online sports betting in the wake of the US Supreme Court’s decision earlier this year to overturn the federal ban on such gambling. Several other states, including Colorado, Mississippi, and New Jersey, have already passed laws authorizing sports betting.

#  Michigan Lawmakers Push for Legalization of Online Sports Betting

Michigan lawmakers are currently pushing for the legalization of online sports betting in the state.

 Senate Bill 889, introduced by Senators Curtis Hertel Jr. and Jeff Irwin, would legalize sports betting through the use of mobile apps and websites. The bill would also allow casinos and racetracks in Michigan to offer sports betting.

"It's 2017," said Senator Hertel. "People are already betting on sports illegally. We might as well regulate it, tax it, and make sure that the revenues go to good causes."

Senator Irwin added, "This is a common sense bill that will create jobs, generate revenue for our schools and help protect consumers."

Under the proposed bill, revenues from online sports betting would be used to fund public education in Michigan. The bill would also establish a Gaming Control Board to regulate online sports betting in the state.

If passed, Michigan would join a growing number of states that have legalized online sports betting. In May 2017, the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had prohibited legalized sports betting nationwide. Since then, several states have moved to legalize sports betting within their borders.

Opponents of online sports betting argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other negative consequences. However, supporters say that legalizing online sports betting will bring much-needed revenue to states and create jobs.

#  State Legislators Introduce Bill to Legalize Online Sports Gambling

This week, a group of state legislators in the US introduced a bill that would legalize online sports gambling. The move is seen as a way to help states generate new revenue, as well as bring more oversight to an activity that has long taken place in the shadows.

The proposed bill, called the “Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Development Amendment Act of 2019”, was sponsored by a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House of Representatives. It would allow states to license and regulate online sports gambling, including wagers on both amateur and professional games.

Proponents of the bill argue that it would provide much-needed new revenue for cash-strapped states. They also say that it would help to regulate an industry that has long been rife with illegal activity.

Opponents of the bill, however, argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction and other social problems. They also contend that it would violate federal law and could lead to lawsuits from gaming companies.

If passed, the bill would mark a major shift in policy for the United States. Online gambling is currently illegal under federal law, although there are some exceptions for state-regulated lotteries.

It remains to be seen whether this latest effort will be successful in legalizing online sports gambling. But with many states struggling to find new sources of revenue, it is likely that this issue will continue to be debated in the years ahead.
