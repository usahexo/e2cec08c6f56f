Supporters of the casino argue that it will create jobs and bring much-needed revenue to the area. They also say that the casino will be good for the tourism industry, as people will come from all over to visit.

Opponents of the casino worry that it will cannibalize business from existing casinos and businesses in the area. They also fear that it will lead to increased crime and gambling addiction.
