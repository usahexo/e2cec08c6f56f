            <h1 id="What-is-the-Andar-Bahar-game"><a href="#What-is-the-Andar-Bahar-game" class="headerlink" title="What is the Andar Bahar game?"></a>What is the Andar Bahar game?</h1><p>The Andar Bahar game is a popular card game in India that is similar to poker. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards and two players. The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player with the highest hand at the end of the game wins.</p>
<p>There are four rounds in Andar Bahar. In each round, players are dealt five cards. The player with the highest card starts the round and play passes clockwise. Play continues until one player either has no cards left or goes bust (goes over 21). In the event of a tie, both players draw one more card and compare again. The player with the highest card then starts the next round.</p>
<p>The player who wins two out of four rounds wins the game.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-play-Andar-Bahar"><a href="#How-to-play-Andar-Bahar" class="headerlink" title="How to play Andar Bahar"></a>How to play Andar Bahar</h1><p>To begin, each player is dealt five cards face down. The player with the highest-ranking card (Aces are high) starts the round and play passes clockwise. On a player’s turn, they must play one card from their hand into the middle of the table. The suit of this card is irrelevant; all that matters is the rank of the card. If a player cannot play any more cards, they must draw one from the deck and continue playing until they can play again.</p>
<p>If a player plays a card that matches the rank of one currently in play, they capture that card and put it into their hand. If two or more players have cards of equal rank, those cards cancel each other out and neither player captures them. As play progresses, it’s possible for multiple players to have captured cards at any given time - these are kept in a temporary stack in front of each player).</p>
<p>When all players have played their last card, Whichever player has collected most number of points from their captured cards (or from cancelling out other players’ points) becomes winner .</p>
<p>  Some simple examples: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Let’s say there are two Jacks on table, and Player A plays another Jack . That would mean Player A captures both Jacks and gets 10 points (2*5) .<br>But if Player B plays another Jack too , then Player A only captures 1 Jack since 2 cancel out . So Player A gets 5 points in total instead .</p>
</li>
<li><p>Let’s say there are three Kings on table, and Player A plays another King . That would mean Player A captures all 3 Kings and gets 15 points (3*5) .   But if Player B also plays King , then neither player captures any King ! So no one gets any points for Kings at all .</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Is-there-a-strategy-for-winning-at-Andar-Bahar"><a href="#Is-there-a-strategy-for-winning-at-Andar-Bahar" class="headerlink" title="Is there a strategy for winning at Andar Bahar?"></a>Is there a strategy for winning at Andar Bahar?</h1><p>There is no one definitive answer to this question. However, there are a few tips that can help you increase your chances of winning at Andar Bahar.</p>
<p>First, it is important to understand the basic rules of the game. Andar Bahar is a two-player game where each player is dealt 13 cards. The goal of the game is to remove all of the cards from your hand. There are a few different ways to do this, but the most common way is to pair up cards of the same rank and then discard them.</p>
<p>Another important thing to keep in mind is which cards are worth points. In general, face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are worth 10 points each, while other cards are worth their rank value (Ace through 10). There are also bonus points available for specific combinations: sequences (three or more cards of the same rank), runs (three or more cards in sequence of different suits), pairs (two cards of the same rank) and four-of-a-kind (four cards of the same rank).</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are a few tips for winning at Andar Bahar:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Try to form as many high-point combinations as possible. This will give you a large point advantage over your opponent.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep track of which cards your opponent has discarded. This will help you determine which cards they still have in their hand and which ones are likely to be played soon.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have a card that can potentially form two different combinations (e.g., two sixes), try to hold onto it until you can determine which combination will give you the most points.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be mindful of the card values when choosing which combinations to discard. For example, it might be worth keeping a three and discarding a four if your opponent only has one card left and it’s a four. This will prevent them from being able to form a run with their last card.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use your jokers wisely! Jokers can be used as substitutes for any other card in the deck, so use them strategically to block your opponent’s chances of forming high-point combinations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
