Legends of New York, the popular board game set in and around the big apple, is getting its own casino. But this won't be your average gaming den - the not-for-profit organisation will use the proceeds to fund social programs in the city.

The Legends of New York Casino will be situated in lower Manhattan, close to where the game was set. It is hoped that the project will create jobs and bring revenue to local businesses. In addition, a percentage of the profits from the casino will be donated to charities working in the areas of poverty relief, education and healthcare.

The idea for the casino came about after it was revealed that New York State had given permission for gambling venues to be set up outside of traditional casinos. Michael de Grasse, president of the Legends of New York Corporation and one of the game's creators, saw this as an opportunity to make his game more than just a pastime. "We wanted to do something more with it," he said in an interview with The Huffington Post. "To make it a real force for good."

The team behind Legends of New York has been working on plans for the casino for over two years now and they are confident that it will be a success. They are currently looking for investors and have already started building the facilities. The casino is scheduled to open its doors in early 2017.

#  State Approves Legends of New York Game to Operate as Nonprofit Casino

Legends of New York, the popular virtual reality game that simulates running a casino, has won approval from the state to operate as a nonprofit casino.

The game, which has more than 1 million users, will now be able to offer real-money gambling games such as blackjack and slots. In order to comply with state regulations, Legends of New York will donate a portion of its revenue to charity.

"We're excited to receive approval from the state and begin offering our players exciting new gambling games," said Carlos Gomez, CEO of Legends of New York. "We're committed to giving back to the community and look forward to working with local charities to help make a difference."

Since its launch in 2016, Legends of New York has become one of the most popular online casinos. The game offers a realistic gaming experience, complete with beautiful graphics and immersive sound effects. Players can choose from a variety of games, including blackjack, slots, roulette, and baccarat.

In addition to its real-money games, Legends of New York also offers free-play options for those who want to enjoy the game without spending money. The casino is available on PC and Mac platforms as well as mobile devices.

#  Plans for Nonprofit Casino in New York Moving Forward

A potential nonprofit casino in Albany, New York is gaining steam, as officials and representatives from the casino industry continue to work on a proposal.
The project, which is being spearheaded by the chamber of commerce, would like to see a nonprofit casino built in the city that could help generate revenue for local schools and businesses.

“There’s clearly interest in this project — from the business community, from labor, from all walks of life,” said Michael Miller, the chamber’s president and CEO.
The proposed casino would be run by an entity separate from the chamber, and it would be open to anyone 21 or older.

If the proposal moves forward, it would need to be approved by state lawmakers. Casino gambling is currently only legal in five of New York’s 62 counties.

Albany is one of several cities across the country that are exploring the idea of a nonprofit casino as a way to help bolster their economies. In Pennsylvania, for example, officials are looking into whether a nonprofit casino could help revive the struggling city of Reading.

Supporters of such proposals argue that a nonprofit casino can be run more efficiently than a for-profit one, and that its proceeds can be used to benefit the community. Critics say that such casinos can cannibalize revenue from other businesses and can create social ills like addiction and crime.
